This folder contains all necessary code, as well as psuedocode, pertaining to the operation
of the Drone Companion. Coding will be done in C and interfaced with an Arduino Nano. 

In the section below, each simulation serves as a basic example of how each of the hardware components will interact with our software individually and
how the software will communicate I/O data between different combinations of components.
