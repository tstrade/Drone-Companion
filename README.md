# Drone-Companion
We will implement an assistive technology drone that will fly at a specific height above the user and detect, avoid, and alert when there are any obstacles. Obstacle can be constituted as anything that is large and can be ran into when walking around outside or in a building (i.e. walls, poles, tables, chairs, other people).  

The drone will follow the user while they walk around, maintaining that same distance every time the user moves while also monitoring the environment around the user to detect and avoid any other obstacles. It will specifically alert the user when there is an object in front of them that is getting closer and within some fixed proximity.
